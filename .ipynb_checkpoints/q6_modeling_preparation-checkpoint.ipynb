    "## Your Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Select target variable:**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   target = 'Water Temperature'  # Choose a meaningful target\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Select features:**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   # Exclude target and non-numeric columns\n",
    "   feature_cols = [col for col in df.columns \n",
    "                   if col != target \n",
    "                   and pd.api.types.is_numeric_dtype(df[col])]\n",
    "   \n",
    "   # CRITICAL: Exclude features derived from the target variable\n",
    "   # If predicting Air Temperature, exclude features that use Air Temperature\n",
    "   features_to_exclude = [\n",
    "       'temp_difference',  # Uses Air Temperature\n",
    "       'temp_ratio',  # Uses Air Temperature\n",
    "       'temp_category',  # Derived from Air Temperature\n",
    "       'comfort_index',  # Uses Air Temperature\n",
    "   ]\n",
    "   feature_cols = [col for col in feature_cols if col not in features_to_exclude]\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Handle categorical variables:**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   # One-hot encode if needed\n",
    "   # Example: If you have 'Station Name' or 'temp_category' columns\n",
    "   categorical_cols = ['Station Name', 'temp_category', 'wind_category']  # Adjust based on your data\n",
    "   categorical_cols = [col for col in categorical_cols if col in df.columns]  # Only encode columns that exist\n",
    "   \n",
    "   if categorical_cols:\n",
    "       df_encoded = pd.get_dummies(df, columns=categorical_cols, prefix=categorical_cols, drop_first=True)\n",
    "       # Update feature_cols to include encoded columns\n",
    "       encoded_cols = [col for col in df_encoded.columns if any(cat in col for cat in categorical_cols)]\n",
    "       feature_cols = [col for col in feature_cols if col not in categorical_cols] + encoded_cols\n",
    "       df = df_encoded\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Perform temporal train/test split:**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   # CRITICAL: Sort by datetime first\n",
    "   df = df.sort_index()\n",
    "   \n",
    "   # Split by time (e.g., 80/20)\n",
    "   split_idx = int(len(df) * 0.8)\n",
    "   \n",
    "   X_train = df[feature_cols].iloc[:split_idx]\n",
    "   X_test = df[feature_cols].iloc[split_idx:]\n",
    "   y_train = df[target].iloc[:split_idx]\n",
    "   y_test = df[target].iloc[split_idx:]\n",
    "   \n",
    "   # Verify no data leakage\n",
    "   assert df.index[split_idx-1] < df.index[split_idx], \"Data leakage detected!\"\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Save artifacts:**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   X_train.to_csv('output/q6_X_train.csv', index=False)\n",
    "   X_test.to_csv('output/q6_X_test.csv', index=False)\n",
    "   y_train.to_csv('output/q6_y_train.csv', index=False, header=[target])\n",
    "   y_test.to_csv('output/q6_y_test.csv', index=False, header=[target])\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Document split:**\n",

    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Feature Selection Guidelines\n",
    "\n",
    "When selecting features for modeling, think critically about each feature:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Red Flags to Watch For:**\n",
    "- **Circular logic**: Does this feature use the target variable to predict the target?\n",
    "  - Example: Rolling mean of target, lag of target (if not handled carefully)\n",
    "  - Example: If predicting `Air Temperature`, using `air_temp_rolling_7h` is circular - you're predicting temperature from smoothed temperature\n",
    "- **Data leakage**: Does this feature contain information that wouldn't be available at prediction time?\n",
    "  - Example: Future values, aggregated statistics that include the current value\n",
    "- **Near-duplicates**: Is this feature nearly identical to the target?\n",
    "  - Check correlations - if correlation > 0.95, investigate whether it's legitimate\n",
    "  - Example: A feature with 99%+ correlation with the target is likely problematic\n",
    "\n",
    "**Good Practices:**\n",
    "- Use external predictors (other weather variables, temporal features)\n",
    "- Create rolling windows of **predictors**, not the target\n",
    "  - Good: `wind_speed_rolling_7h`, `humidity_rolling_24h`\n",
    "  - Bad: `air_temp_rolling_7h` when predicting Air Temperature\n",
    "- Use derived features that combine multiple predictors\n",
    "- Think: \"Would I have this information when making a real prediction?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Remember:** The goal is to predict the target from **other** information, not from the target itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Decision Points\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Target variable:** What do you want to predict? Temperature? Water conditions? Choose something meaningful and measurable.\n",
    "- **Temporal split:** **CRITICAL** - Use temporal split (earlier data for training, later data for testing), NOT random split. Why? Time series data has temporal dependencies. Typical split: 80/20 or 70/30.\n",
    "- **Feature selection:** Which features are most relevant? Consider correlations, domain knowledge, and feature importance from previous analysis.\n",
    "- **Categorical encoding:** If you have categorical variables, encode them (one-hot encoding, label encoding, etc.) before modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Checkpoint\n",
    "\n",
    "After Q6, you should have:\n",
    "- [ ] Temporal train/test split completed (earlier → train, later → test)\n",
    "- [ ] Features prepared (no target, no datetime index)\n",
    "- [ ] Categorical variables encoded\n",
    "- [ ] No data leakage verified\n",
    "- [ ] All 5 artifacts saved: `q6_X_train.csv`, `q6_X_test.csv`, `q6_y_train.csv`, `q6_y_test.csv`, `q6_train_test_info.txt`\n",
