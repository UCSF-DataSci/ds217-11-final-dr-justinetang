    "\n",
    "Identify trends over time, analyze seasonal patterns, and create correlation analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Time Series Note:** Time series data has temporal patterns (trends, seasonality, cycles). Use time-based aggregations and visualizations to identify these patterns. See **Lecture 09** for time series decomposition and pattern analysis. Use pandas `resample()` to aggregate by time periods (e.g., `resample('ME')` for monthly, `resample('D')` for daily) and `groupby()` with temporal features (hour, day_of_week, month) to identify patterns.\n",

    "## Your Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Identify trends:**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   # Aggregate by time period (e.g., monthly)\n",
    "   monthly_avg = df.resample('ME').agg({\n",
    "       'Air Temperature': 'mean',\n",
    "       'Water Temperature': 'mean'\n",
    "   })\n",
    "   # Plot trends\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Analyze seasonal patterns:**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   # By month\n",
    "   monthly_pattern = df.groupby('month').agg({\n",
    "       'Air Temperature': 'mean',\n",
    "       'Water Temperature': 'mean'\n",
    "   })\n",
    "   \n",
    "   # By hour\n",
    "   hourly_pattern = df.groupby('hour').agg({\n",
    "       'Air Temperature': 'mean'\n",
    "   })\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Create correlation analysis:**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   # Select numeric columns\n",
    "   numeric_cols = df.select_dtypes(include=[np.number]).columns\n",
    "   corr_matrix = df[numeric_cols].corr()\n",
    "   corr_matrix.to_csv('output/q5_correlations.csv')\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Create visualizations:**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   fig, axes = plt.subplots(2, 2, figsize=(16, 12))\n",
    "   # Plot 1: Trends\n",
    "   # Plot 2: Seasonal patterns\n",
    "   # Plot 3: Correlation heatmap\n",
    "   # Plot 4: Additional pattern\n",
    "   plt.savefig('output/q5_patterns.png', dpi=150, bbox_inches='tight')\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Document patterns:**\n",
    "   - Write summary to `output/q5_trend_summary.txt`\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Decision Points\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Trend identification:** Is there a long-term trend? Is it increasing, decreasing, or stable? Use time series plots to visualize.\n",
    "- **Seasonal patterns:** Are there daily patterns? Weekly? Monthly? Use aggregations and visualizations to identify.\n",
    "- **Correlation analysis:** Which variables are correlated? Use correlation matrix and heatmaps. Focus on relationships that might be useful for modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Checkpoint\n",
    "\n",
    "After Q5, you should have:\n",
    "- [ ] Trends identified\n",
    "- [ ] Seasonal patterns analyzed\n",
    "- [ ] Correlations calculated\n",
    "- [ ] Pattern visualizations created\n",
    "- [ ] All 3 artifacts saved: `q5_correlations.csv`, `q5_patterns.png`, `q5_trend_summary.txt`\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
