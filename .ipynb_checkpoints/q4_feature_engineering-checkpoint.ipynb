    "\n",
    "Create derived features, perform time-based aggregations, and calculate rolling windows for time series analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Time Series Note:** Rolling windows are essential for time series data. They capture temporal dependencies (e.g., 7-hour rolling mean captures short-term patterns). See **Lecture 09** for time series rolling window operations. For hourly data, common window sizes are 7-24 hours (capturing daily patterns). Use pandas `rolling()` method with `window` parameter to specify the number of periods.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Required Artifacts\n",
    "\n",
    "You must create exactly these 3 files in the `output/` directory:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. `output/q4_features.csv`\n",
    "**Format:** CSV file\n",
    "**Content:** Dataset with all derived features added\n",
    "**Requirements:**\n",
    "- All original columns from Q3\n",
    "- All new derived features added as columns\n",
    "- **No index column** (save with `index=False`)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. `output/q4_rolling_features.csv`\n",
    "**Format:** CSV file\n",
    "**Content:** Dataset with rolling window features\n",
    "**Required Columns:**\n",
    "- Original datetime column\n",
    "- At least one rolling window calculation column (e.g., `water_temp_rolling_7h`, `air_temp_rolling_24h`)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Requirements:**\n",
    "- Must include at least one rolling window calculation\n",
    "- Rolling window names should be descriptive (e.g., `temp_rolling_7h` for 7-hour rolling mean)\n",
    "- **No index column** (save with `index=False`)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example columns:**\n",
    "```csv\n",
    "Measurement Timestamp,wind_speed_rolling_7h,humidity_rolling_24h,pressure_rolling_7h\n",
    "2022-01-01 00:00:00,6.8,65.2,1013.5\n",
    "2022-01-01 01:00:00,6.9,65.3,1013.6\n",
    "...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** The example shows rolling windows of predictor variables (wind speed, humidity, pressure), not the target variable. If you're predicting Air Temperature, do NOT create rolling windows of Air Temperature - this causes data leakage.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. `output/q4_feature_list.txt`\n",
    "**Format:** Plain text file\n",
    "**Content:** List of new features created (one per line)\n",
    "**Requirements:**\n",
    "- One feature name per line\n",
    "- No extra text, just feature names\n",
    "- Include all derived features, rolling features, and categorical features created\n",

    "\n",
    "- [ ] Derived features created (differences, ratios, interactions, etc.)\n",
    "- [ ] Time-based aggregations performed (by hour, day, month, etc.) - optional but recommended\n",
    "- [ ] At least one rolling window calculation (rolling mean, rolling median, etc.)\n",
    "- [ ] Categorical features created (if applicable)\n",
    "- [ ] Feature list documented\n",
    "- [ ] All 3 required artifacts saved with exact filenames\n",

    "\n",
    "## Your Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Create derived features:**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   # Examples:\n",
    "   df['temp_difference'] = df['Air Temperature'] - df['Water Temperature']\n",
    "   df['temp_ratio'] = df['Air Temperature'] / (df['Water Temperature'] + 0.1)  # Avoid division by zero\n",
    "   df['wind_speed_squared'] = df['Wind Speed'] ** 2\n",
    "   df['comfort_index'] = (df['Air Temperature'] * 0.4 + \n",
    "                         (100 - df['Humidity']) * 0.3 + \n",
    "                         (20 - df['Wind Speed']) * 0.3)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Calculate rolling windows:**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   # Ensure datetime index is set and sorted\n",
    "   df = df.sort_index()\n",
    "   \n",
    "   # Rolling windows (examples - use predictor variables only, not your target variable)\n",
    "   df['wind_speed_rolling_7h'] = df['Wind Speed'].rolling(window=7, min_periods=1).mean()\n",
    "   df['wind_speed_rolling_24h'] = df['Wind Speed'].rolling(window=24, min_periods=1).mean()\n",
    "   df['humidity_rolling_7h'] = df['Humidity'].rolling(window=7, min_periods=1).mean()\n",
    "   df['pressure_rolling_7h'] = df['Barometric Pressure'].rolling(window=7, min_periods=1).mean()\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   \n",
    "   ⚠️ **Important:** Only create rolling windows of **predictor variables**, not your target variable. Creating rolling windows of the target variable causes data leakage (you'd be predicting the target from a smoothed version of itself). See Q6 and Q7 for more details on avoiding data leakage.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Create categorical features (optional):**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   df['temp_category'] = pd.cut(df['Air Temperature'], \n",
    "                                bins=[-np.inf, 10, 20, 30, np.inf],\n",
    "                                labels=['Cold', 'Cool', 'Warm', 'Hot'])\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Check for infinity values:**\n",
    "   - After creating derived features (especially ratios), check for infinity values:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   # Replace infinity with NaN, then handle appropriately\n",
    "   df = df.replace([np.inf, -np.inf], np.nan)\n",
    "   # Fill or drop as needed based on your analysis\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Document and save:**\n",
    "   - Save all features: `df.reset_index().to_csv('output/q4_features.csv', index=False)`\n",
    "     - **Important:** When saving CSVs with datetime index, use `reset_index()` to convert index to column, otherwise it will not be included in the output.\n",
    "   - Save rolling features: `df[['rolling_col1', 'rolling_col2', ...]].reset_index().to_csv('output/q4_rolling_features.csv', index=False)`\n",
    "     - **Important:** Remember to use `reset_index()` before saving to include the datetime as a column.\n",
    "   - Write feature list: `with open('output/q4_feature_list.txt', 'w') as f: f.write('\\n'.join(feature_names))`\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Decision Points\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Derived features:** What relationships might be useful? Temperature differences? Ratios? Interactions between variables?\n",
    "- **Rolling windows:** What window size makes sense? 7 hours? 24 hours? Consider the temporal scale of your data. For hourly data, 7-24 hours captures daily patterns.\n",
    "- **Time-based aggregations:** Aggregate by hour? Day? Week? What temporal granularity is useful for your analysis?\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Checkpoint\n",
    "\n",
    "After Q4, you should have:\n",
    "- [ ] Derived features created\n",
    "- [ ] At least one rolling window calculation\n",
    "- [ ] Feature list documented\n",
    "- [ ] All 3 artifacts saved: `q4_features.csv`, `q4_rolling_features.csv`, `q4_feature_list.txt`\n",
