    "## ⚠️ Data Leakage Warning\n",
    "\n",
    "If you see suspiciously perfect model performance, this likely indicates data leakage. Common warning signs:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Warning Metrics:**\n",
    "- **Perfect R² = 1.0000** (or very close, like 0.9999+)\n",
    "- **Zero or near-zero RMSE/MAE** (e.g., RMSE < 0.01°C for temperature prediction)\n",
    "- **Train and test performance nearly identical** (difference < 0.01)\n",
    "- **Unrealistic precision**: Errors smaller than measurement precision (e.g., < 0.1°C for temperature sensors)\n",
    "- **Feature correlation > 0.99** with target (check correlations between features and target)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Common Causes:**\n",
    "- **Circular prediction logic**: Using rolling windows of the target variable to predict itself\n",
    "  - Example: Using `air_temp_rolling_7h` to predict `Air Temperature`\n",
    "  - This is like predicting temperature from smoothed temperature - circular reasoning!\n",
    "- **Features nearly identical to target**: Any feature with correlation > 0.99 with the target\n",
    "- **Including target variable directly**: Accidentally including the target in features\n",
    "\n",
    "**How to Check:**\n",
    "- Calculate correlations between each feature and the target\n",
    "- If any feature has correlation > 0.95, investigate whether it's legitimate or leakage\n",
    "- For time series: Be especially careful with rolling windows, lag features, or any transformation of the target variable\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example of Problematic Feature:**\n",
    "- `air_temp_rolling_7h` (7-hour rolling mean of Air Temperature) when predicting Air Temperature\n",
    "- This feature has ~99.4% correlation with the target - too high to be useful and indicates circular logic\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:**\n",
    "- Only create rolling windows for **predictor variables**, not the target\n",
    "- Use rolling windows of: Wind Speed, Humidity, Barometric Pressure, etc.\n",
    "- Avoid rolling windows of: Air Temperature (if that's your target)\n",
    "\n",

    "## Your Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Train Model 1 (e.g., Linear Regression):**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   lr_model = LinearRegression()\n",
    "   lr_model.fit(X_train, y_train)\n",
    "   lr_train_pred = lr_model.predict(X_train)\n",
    "   lr_test_pred = lr_model.predict(X_test)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Train Model 2 (e.g., XGBoost):**\n",

    "   rf_train_pred = rf_model.predict(X_train)\n",
    "   rf_test_pred = rf_model.predict(X_test)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Calculate metrics:**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   # At minimum, calculate one metric for each model\n",
    "   # R² works for both Linear Regression and XGBoost (suggested)\n",
    "   train_r2 = r2_score(y_train, train_pred)\n",
    "   test_r2 = r2_score(y_test, test_pred)\n",
    "   \n",
    "   # Alternative metrics that also work for both models:\n",
    "   # RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)\n",
    "   train_rmse = np.sqrt(mean_squared_error(y_train, train_pred))\n",
    "   test_rmse = np.sqrt(mean_squared_error(y_test, test_pred))\n",
    "   \n",
    "   # MAE (Mean Absolute Error)\n",
    "   train_mae = mean_absolute_error(y_train, train_pred)\n",

    "   ```python\n",
    "   feature_importance = pd.DataFrame({\n",
    "       'feature': X_train.columns,\n",
    "       'importance': xgb_model.feature_importances_\n",

    "\n",
    "## Decision Points\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Model selection:** Train at least 2 different models. We suggest starting with **Linear Regression** and **XGBoost** - these work well and demonstrate different modeling approaches (linear vs gradient boosting). You may choose other models if appropriate (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, etc.). See Lecture 11 Notebook 4 for examples.\n",
    "- **Evaluation metrics:** Report at least one metric for each model. We suggest **R² score** (coefficient of determination) - it works for both Linear Regression and XGBoost, and all regression models. It measures the proportion of variance explained and is easy to interpret. Alternative metrics that work well for both models include **RMSE** (Root Mean Squared Error) or **MAE** (Mean Absolute Error). You may include additional metrics if relevant (e.g., MAPE, adjusted R²). Compare train vs test performance to check for overfitting.\n",
    "- **Feature importance:** If using tree-based models (like XGBoost), extract feature importance to understand which features matter most.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Interpreting Model Performance\n",
    "\n",
    "**Warning Signs of Data Leakage:**\n",
    "- R² = 1.0000 (perfect score) or R² > 0.999\n",
    "- RMSE or MAE = 0.0 or unrealistically small (< 0.01 for temperature)\n",
    "- Train and test performance nearly identical (difference < 0.01)\n",
    "- Any feature with correlation > 0.99 with target\n",
    "\n",
    "**Realistic Expectations:**\n",
    "- For temperature prediction: RMSE of 0.5-2.0°C is realistic\n",
    "- R² of 0.85-0.98 is strong but realistic\n",
    "- Some difference between train and test performance is normal\n",
    "\n",
    "**If you see warning signs:**\n",
    "1. Check your features for data leakage (see Data Leakage Warning above)\n",
    "2. Calculate correlations between features and target\n",
    "3. Remove features that are transformations of the target variable\n",
    "4. Re-train models and verify performance is now realistic\n",
